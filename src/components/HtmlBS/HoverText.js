        simulation, so feel free to drag around any of the 3D Objects you see!

        Working with the Digital Scholarship Lab at the University of Rochester
        was when I was first introduced to JS and React. Refactoring
        functionality in Resurrect3D, a Digital Heritage 3D model viewer, was
        where I was first introduced to React Three Fiber. I also got hands-on
        experience with basic 3D modeling in Blender. Most of the models on this
        website are made by me!

        StudioX is an XR peer-to-peer learning space for VR, AR, and MR
        experiences. As a Karp Library Fellow, I serve as StudioX's XR
        Developer. I curate workshopes for students, faculty, and community
        members on developing XR applications using Unity for a variety of
        devices. Engaging with other peers, I've developed and assisted in the
        production of AR and VR research-related prototypes. I've also presented
        at various virtual and in-person events on the topic of XR in education.

        After creating Sea Ventures (see below ship), I had the opportunity to
        develop a workflow for converting large point clouds into decimated
        minimal meshes for a historical tour of the Elmina castle developed in
        Unity. I also got to build a FreeNas server from both the hardware and
        software level that is still in use 2 years later!

        My team's submission for the 2019 GameJam hosted by the UR Video Game
        Development Club, winning 2nd Place. Using the frog theme as

        mechanics and the core gameplay features.

        My team's submission for the 2021 DandyHacks Hackathon at the University
        of Rochester winning 1st Place in the video game track. With an entirely
        unique soundtrack and mostly custom pixel-art (minus the tilesets),
        Trowel is a simple RNG-based rogue-like with a heavy emphasis on
        min-maxing mechanics. Being the sole developer I designed it to be a fun
        but brief experience that keeps you coming back again and again for
        another playthrough.

        This was my first Unity project since the days of Slenderman. It is a
        historical text-based game based on the discovery of Bermuda. As the
        Sole Developer, not only was I responsible for implementing features,
        but also anything regarding using the Unity Engine. Meeting our deadline
        of 3 months, Sea Ventures was met with siginificant positive feedback
        from faculty from related departments after a presentation at the end of
        the deadline.
